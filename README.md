# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-CNN
Handwritten Digit Classification is a deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits. It is Trained and Tested on the MNIST dataset. The model's seven-layer architecture ensures high accuracy in digit recognition.

The project is implemented using Python with TensorFlow and Keras for building the CNN model. The dataset used was MNIST, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The approach involved:

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of images for better model performance.

Model Architecture: Designed a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Training and Optimization: Used cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer for efficient learning.

Evaluation: Assessed accuracy and loss using test data and experimented with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

The final model achieved over 98% accuracy on the test set. This project deepened my understanding of deep learning, CNNs, and model optimization. It also gave me hands-on experience with TensorFlow, which is crucial for AI and ML applications.
